Abstract

A low-cost real-time data acquisition system utilising a master (PC-XT) and a slave (Z80) computer
for high-resolution atomic spectroscopy is described. The master and the slave computer are linked
by a high-speed parallel FIFO buffer permitting data acquisition on a fixed time schedule with 
4 mu s time resolution. A modular interface box allows the system to control complex spectroscopic 
experiments. The use of commercial software packages allows fast and efficient data reduction and 
analysis on the same computer system. The performance of the system has been demonstrated in 
polarisation spectroscopy experiment on zirconium.
